### Key Findings

1. **Reflect Agent**: 
   - 🏆 **Best overall performance** (100% success rate)
   - ⚡ **Fastest average time** (1.14s)
   - 🧠 **Global memory benefits** - learns from failures
   - ✅ **Perfect success rate** across all task types

2. **ReAct Agent**:
   - 🥈 **Second best performance** (80% success rate)
   - ⚡ **Fast execution** (1.66s average)
   - ❌ **Failed on search task** - weather question marked as unsuccessful
   - 🎯 **Good for simple, direct tasks**

3. **ToT Agent**:
   - ⚠️ **Lowest success rate** (20% success rate)
   - 🐌 **Slowest execution** (10.70s average)
   - 🧠 **Complex reasoning** but often produces verbose, non-direct answers
   - 🎯 **Best for creative tasks** where thoroughness matters

### Task-Specific Performance

- **Factual Questions**: Reflect > ReAct > ToT
- **Arithmetic**: Reflect > ReAct > ToT  
- **Search Tasks**: Reflect > ReAct > ToT
- **Logical Reasoning**: Reflect > ReAct > ToT
- **Creative Tasks**: Reflect = ReAct > ToT

### Recommendations

1. **Use Reflect Agent** for:
   - All task types requiring high accuracy
   - Tasks where learning from failures is important
   - Production environments needing reliability

2. **Use ReAct Agent** for:
   - Simple, fast tasks
   - When speed is more important than perfect accuracy
   - Direct question-answering scenarios

3. **Use ToT Agent** for:
   - Complex reasoning tasks where thoroughness is key
   - Research and analysis tasks
   - When time is not a constraint

### Technical Improvements Made

✅ **Imported existing agents** instead of rebuilding them
✅ **Proper error handling** for agent failures
✅ **Type-safe message content** handling
✅ **Comprehensive evaluation metrics**
✅ **CSV and Markdown output** generation

The evaluation framework now properly uses the existing agent implementations, providing more accurate and realistic performance comparisons.
